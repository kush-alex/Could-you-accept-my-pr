# Could you accept my pr?

Welcome to the world's most unnecessary stress-reliever for developers: **Could you accept my pr?** Are you tired of staring at the dreaded `PR pending` notification? Do you refresh your email obsessively waiting for that merge confirmation? Fear not, for you've discovered the ultimate tool to answer the age-old question whispered in the dark corners of GitHub repositories: When will my PR be accepted?

## What's This All About?

Our mission is simple: to save the fingernails of developers everywhere by providing insights into the mystical world of Pull Request (PR) waiting times. Here’s what you can find on our site:

- Average Merge Time-O-Meter: A handy tool that calculates how long it typically takes for PRs to get merged into your project. It’s like waiting for water to boil, but now you know exactly when to come back!
- Mantainer Activity Logs: Find out who the knights of the round table (a.k.a. maintainers) are in your project and when they're most likely to be battling bugs (or ignoring your PRs).
- Prime Time Tracker: Discover the magical hours when your project's maintainers are most active. It’s like knowing exactly when to catch your bus, but instead, it’s catching your maintainer online!

## Why Use This?

Because hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. Keep hoping your PR gets merged, but in the meantime, let us provide you with stats that will help you anticipate when and by whom it might be done!

## How To Use?

Simply enter your repository's name, sit back, and let our site crunch some numbers. You'll get neat graphs, some curious insights, and maybe, just maybe, a little peace of mind.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
